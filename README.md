# Polyfit

**Equation Finder for bulk data set (Bulk generator)**

This Code genertes one Excel file containing "the Curve fitting equation parameters" for an input dataset (x,y) for any number of dataset files in CSV format.

for each dataset file , a corresponding sheet in the excel file will be generated containing it's Curve fitting equation parameters.

**Requirements:**


1-The Data set saved in CSV files (the header should be (x,y))

2-Locate the CSV files and the Python file in the same folder

3-Copy the CSV files in another separate directory with no other files with it.

4-adjust the list directory path in the code

**Outputs:**


1-Excel file contains number of sheets equal to the number of the CSV files , mentioining the equation parameters of each CSV data set

2-the Plot will pop up for every file , you should close it or save it before go to the next data set.

**Execution:**


1-Run the Python file

2-Enter the degree of the Polynomial function you want to use for curve fitting 

3-close or save the pop up plot 

4-Enter the degree of the polynomial function for the next data set
