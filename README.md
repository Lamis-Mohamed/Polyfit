# Polyfit
Equation Finder for bulk data set 


**Requirements:**


1-The Data set saved in CSV files (the header should be (x,y))
2-Locate the CSV files and the Python file in the same folder
3-Copy the CSV files in another separate directory with no other files with it.
4-adjust the list directory path in the code

**Outputs:**


1-Excel file contains number of sheets equal to the number of the CSV files , mentioining the equation parameters of each CSV data set
2-the Plot will pop up for every file , you should close it or save it before go to the next data set.

**Execution:**


1-Run the Python file
2-Enter the degree of the Polynomial function you want to use for curve fitting 
3-close or save the pop up plot 
4-Enter the degree of the polynomial function for the next data set
